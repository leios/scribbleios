href="#Becoming-Anything" title="Permalink"></a></h1><p>One morning, without warning, I awoke in an unfamiliar world.</p><p>All I could see was green. Huge blades of grass shot up from the earth below. I tried to move as I normally would, but stumbled onto the ground, falling onto a large, yet gray and furry foot. I tried to jump away, but realized the foot moved <em>with</em> me. It belonged to me.</p><p>Not only was my world different, <em>I</em> was different too. I had no idea what I was or where I was, but I new I had to survive. I looked around, trying to find my bearings, and slowly crawled through the grass. The ground beneath me became wet and muddy, eventually making way onto a clearing and a small pond.</p><p>Here, I could see dark clouds drifting towards the sun. A thunderstorm was coming. Across the pond was a dilapidated tree, where blue birds made their home, chirping away, maybe warning their kin of the oncoming storm.</p><p>I could feel my heart beating faster than I ever imagined it could. I suppose that is normal for a rabbit, but somehow the tempo seemed to be increasing. My gaze leapt around the pond, searching for something, but I didn’t know what. Anxiety flooded my body. I had to run, now.</p><p>But from what? Why?</p><p>Suddenly, behind me, I saw it. All of my subconscious fears materialized into a single entity. A beast, clearly much, much larger than I would ever be, stalking me quietly to my left. Its snout was low to the ground and shoulder hunched. Its red fur was sleek, and calm. Its tail had a white tuft at the end and was tucked beneath its belly. It was a fox.</p><p>For a split second, I froze.</p><p>A complicated blend of emotions ran through me. I knew this was close to the end. I had to move, but where? I didn’t know. I didn’t care. I just ran.</p><p>First, I started moving along the pond and towards the tree on the far side. Can foxes climb? I didn’t really think about it at the time. I was moving off of pure instinct. I knew I was faster, but only for a short run. I needed to get away and do so as quickly as possible.</p><p>After running for as long as I could, I was still far from the tree and dashed back into the grass, trying to recollect myself.</p><p>The fox followed and I could hear it breathing way too close for comfort. I could not survive much longer, and it knew where I was.</p><p>Its muddy paw landed next to me, shaking the earth, but I was paralyzed by both fear and exhaustion. I felt myself fading. All-too-quickly, my vision turned black.</p><p>Suddenly, I felt nothing. No fear. No exhaustion. Nothing at all.</p><p>Was this death? Did I die in that moment?</p><p>No. There was something else. Something more.</p><p>Before me, I saw a blue light. I didn’t know what it was, but I walked towards it and tried to grasp it with my hand… A human hand.</p><p>Suddenly, the world came back to me.</p><p>Green grass before a tumultuous sky and a dilapidated tree. Below me, I saw a rabbit. It was breathing heavily, but immobile. I was the fox.</p><p>I knew what the rabbit had just gone through, and I wanted to let it go. I was a human, after all, right? I had some level of decency. Also, the thought of eating a raw animal still disgusted me.</p><p>For the rest of the day, I stalked the pond as a fox. I didn’t know what to do or where to go, but I enjoyed being at the top of the food chain for a bit. As I felt my hunger grow, I eventually started to wonder if my animal instincts would kick in like they did when I was the rabbit.</p><p>Would I subconsciously become so hungry that I lose my humanity? Would I be forced to eat to survive?  I knew the answer, but didn’t want to admit it. To live, I would need to <em>become</em> the fox.</p><p>I started wondering what happened to the rabbit I had left earlier and ambled my way towards where I had passed out before, only to find that the animal had not moved. It was breathing slower now, but seemed to be in a vegetative state.</p><p>I laid down and rested my snout next to its face. It was entirely gray. A normal hare.</p><p>Why had I woken up as a rabbit? As that being? Where was my actual body? I looked around a bit without any luck, and walked towards the tree for some shelter during the oncoming storm.</p><p>As the day ended, I found myself falling asleep in a deep hunger. Again, I saw a blue light. This time, instead of reaching out, I tried to inspect it.</p><p>It seemed to constantly move, evading my view. I knew I dreaming, and knew this light corresponded to some creature around me, but didn’t know what it was, exactly. I imagined it was a bird on the tree above me.</p><p>Throughout the night, I tried to imagine the physical world as it was when I went to sleep, and found myself controlling a humanoid apparition. I imagined the tree and grass. The rabbit and fox. Then the pond before me.</p><p>I began to wade into it and felt the waters move around me. As I went deeper and deeper, I began see a blue light within the water. By now, I was shoulder deep. The further I walked, the brighter the blue light from water became. I could feel every drop of rain as it pattered on the surface.</p><p>I could feel tadpoles and minnows swimming about. I could feel reeds growing in the shallow regions and lily pads growing on the surface.</p><p>I had become the water, itself.</p><p>As the sun rose in the morning, I began to warm, and so did all the animals inhabiting me. Throughout the day, I had no desire to move. I felt <em>content</em>. Not happy. Not sad. Just <em>content</em>. I served a purpose in a greater ecosystem, and that was OK with me.</p><p>I have no idea how long I was that pond. It might have been days. It might have been weeks. One night, as the moon rose, I began to feel stronger. I don’t know how or why, but I was no longer content being just a pond. I was a human!</p><p>I could do anything!</p><p>I found myself trying to wade out of the pond, but couldn’t. After all, the pond was now part of my identity as well.</p><p>Still, the moon called. Beckoning me closer and closer. I felt a strong connection that forced me to do <em>something</em>. </p><p>So I moved. I began by trying to reach a human hand out of the surface, but the surface tension wouldn’t allow it. If I were to leave, I would have to use more force.</p><p>I coalesced a large body water deep below and stared at the moon beneath the pond’s surface. I was more than just the pond. I was also human. I could do this.</p><p>I launched myself forward, with all the power I could, and quickly found myself floating in the air, somehow floating above myself. Well, at least the being I had come to recognize myself as. I could no longer feel the reeds swaying in the night’s breeze or fish swimming about.</p><p>I was alone for the first time in a long time and it felt exhilarating!</p><p>I kept moving closer and closer to the stars, flying into the heavens above, with the moonlight shimmering throughout my new body.</p><p>I found that I could become anything I imagined. I started out as a human with giant frozen wings of ice, but then realized I could be <em>anything</em>.</p><p>I was once a human, but now I am a werewolf, phoenix, demigod, dragon, alien, demon, merman, vampire, ghost, superhero.</p><p>I am anything I want to be. Anything I can imagine.</p><p>I have no idea where my original body went, but I’m happy enough with the result.</p><hr/><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/hir9aq/wp_finding_out_youve_had_a_basement_the_whole/fwi6rvw/">Prompt: You were once a normal human being.
