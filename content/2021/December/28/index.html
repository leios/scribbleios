lately. I don&#39;t really know why, but when I wake up in the morning, I feel as if I hadn&#39;t slept at all.</p><p>I tried everything! I started going to bed early and made sure I don&#39;t watch anything before laying down. I would wake up later as well to wring out a few extra minutes of sleep every night. I even changed my diet and started working out regularly.</p><p>One day, out of sheer desperation, I asked my doctor if we could to a simple sleep study. A few weeks later, I found myself in a bed, dressed in a hospital gown with small electrodes hooked up to my head. The nurse told me to do what I could to have a &quot;normal&quot; night&#39;s rest and in a matter of minutes, I was unconscious.</p><p>Several hours later, I found myself awake, but not in the bed I fell asleep in. Instead, I was in the chair next to it. Still groggy, I rubbed at my eyes and looked around. The electrodes I had worn the night before were completely missing and the bed had been completely cleaned. &quot;Hello?&quot; I called, &quot;I&#39;m awake now! Sorry, I seem to have moved around a bit in my sleep!&quot;</p><p>I somewhat awkwardly stood and rummaged for my clothes, but couldn&#39;t find them anywhere. Suddenly, the door swung open, revealing the nurse from the night before. Her eyes opened wide when she saw me and she said, &quot;Wait. How are you here?&quot;</p><p>Confused, I asked, &quot;What do you mean? I&#39;ve been here all night, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have been looking for you since 10:30 last night. I left your sleep study for a few minutes to tend to another patient and when I returned...&quot; She shook her head, &quot;Well, I thought you had woken up and walked out.&quot;</p><p>I thought for a bit and said, &quot;Maybe sleep walking?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I thought that as well. I mean, you left all your stuff here as well, but after looking around everywhere, you were just completely gone.&quot; Her eyebrows furrowed a bit and she said, &quot;Wait, come here. I have something to show you.&quot;</p><p>She led me to the monitoring room next door and motioned to one of the monitors. She didn&#39;t say anything for a moment and began clicking through a series of folders before finding one with my patient ID and the date of the study. A video opened up with 4 hours of content, but she quickly clicked on a particular timestamp at 10:30 PM. She then said, &quot;OK. I know this sounds weird, but here&#39;s what happened last night around 10:30...&quot;</p><p>I saw myself sleeping with my head gear and gown. After about a minute, she paused the video and said, &quot;After this, there was a glitch...&quot; When she started the video again, I saw myself disappear. &quot;One moment, you were there. Another moment... Just gone.&quot; She navigated to 10:31:47 and began pressing flipping between two frames, one where I was sleeping soundly, and another where I completely vanished.</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t think I understand. What&#39;s happening?&quot;</p><p>She didn&#39;t look at me, but instead kept flipping between the frames. &quot;Here&#39;s the really weird part. Look at the headset.&quot; As she played the next few frames, the headset rolled a little, sinking towards the bed. &quot;I thought it was a glitch. I kept telling myself you had just gotten up to go to the bathroom and the camera skipped a minute or two, but why would the helmet move like that?&quot;</p><p>She kept rewinding the footage and playing it back.</p><p>I began to feel strangely uncomfortable, and said, &quot;I still don&#39;t know what you mean? I mean, couldn&#39;t the AC have moved it or something.&quot;</p><p>She shook her head without allowing her eyes to leave the video footage. &quot;It&#39;s like you literally disappeared. Just... gone in a single instant.&quot; She sighed and looked at me. &quot;I looked for you for another hour and then cleaned the room and turned the camera off. Your clothes are over there.&quot; She motioned to the corner of the room.</p><p>I slowly began getting dressed without saying a word. The nurse kept scrubbing through the video, trying to figure out what happened. I tried to signal to her and ask if I was free to go, but she was preoccupied with what she saw on her screen.</p><p>I cleared my throat and asked, &quot;So what do we do next?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well,&quot; she turned to me and shook her head a bit, &quot;I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve never seen anything like this. At the very least we need to try this again another night.&quot;</p><p>I sighed, &quot;I see.&quot; If I&#39;m honest, I didn&#39;t know what to think, so I just set up a new appointment and left.</p><p>Throughout the day, I kept feeling like something was off. Like we had just scratched the surface of a far greater mystery. Even if the camera had glitched, where had I gone to that night?</p><p>No matter the case, on the way home, I decided to stop by a local book store and bought a dream journal and textbook on lucid dreaming.</p></article><nav class="docs-footer"><p class="footer-message">Powered by <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Programming Language</a>.</p></nav></div><div class="modal" id="documenter-settings"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Settings</p><button class="delete"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><p><label class="label">Theme</label><div class="select"><select id="documenter-themepicker"><option value="documenter-light">documenter-light</option><option value="documenter-dark">documenter-dark</option><option value="auto">Automatic (OS)</option></select></div></p><hr/><p>This document was generated with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> version 1.2.1 on <span class="colophon-date" title="Tuesday 27 February 2024 13:53">Tuesday 27 February 2024</span>.
