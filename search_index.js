Though many corrupt individuals wanted to become politicians, very few citizens were willing to vote for them. This lead to the \"Real People\" bill, which stipulated that elections were only valid if over 50% of the constituent population voted in them. If an election received less than its required quota, a new election would be made with potentially new candidates.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/April/07/","page":"The Humbler","title":"The Humbler","text":"This lead the the 2032 election crisis where the US was unable to elect an appropriate president as no one was willing to vote for either party. It was then that congress realized a fatal flaw in the bill: there was no stipulation for what would happen if a presidential election was deemed invalid. This meant that the president at the time was kicked out of office unceremoniously, leaving the US without a head to the executive branch.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/April/07/","page":"The Humbler","title":"The Humbler","text":"A secondary election was held and similarly failed. Desperate, congress began incentivizing the public to self-organize and provide additional candidates outside of the two-party system. The idea was that the Republican and Democratic party would provide the same candidates as before, but the people could also propose their own candidates without any party primaries. All candidates above a specified threshold of support would be given a base level of federal funding for their campaign and a new election would be held at the end of March.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/April/07/","page":"The Humbler","title":"The Humbler","text":"Congress thought this project would be mutually beneficial. They needed more people to vote and there was no chance that a third party candidate could win against established parties. Their hope was that the US population would propose a huge number of different candidates all competing against each other, leading to the eventual victory of established choices.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/April/07/","page":"The Humbler","title":"The Humbler","text":"Surprisingly, the US population was extremely organized. A particularly strong candidate by the name Taylor Spitzer made themselves known first on Reddit, then youtube, tiktok, facebook, and every other social media platform. They did not promise much, except that they would \"shake things up\" and \"follow the experts\" on every decision that came their way. After only a week, Taylor was the preferred candidate of the people. In the mid-March primaries, they won against other candidates by fact-checking literally everything they said.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/April/07/","page":"The Humbler","title":"The Humbler","text":"To the surprise of the established parties, Spitzer won the election.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/April/07/","page":"The Humbler","title":"The Humbler","text":"This lead to a new political movement: the Cite-seers. These individuals did everything they could to ensure that politicians were accurate in the information they provided to the public. They also strove to clean up the media landscape so that all publicly funded news organizations were required by law to provide proper citations for every claim they made. Through proper organization online, they effectively crowd-sourced the 2034 midterm election as well which lead to the mass exodus of established politicians, creating a non-binary political system for the first time since George Washington's era.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/April/07/","page":"The Humbler","title":"The Humbler","text":"In 2035, a new bill was proposed by Cite-seeing candidates: \"the Humble Servant.\" This would require every politician to be shadowed an individual that was tongue-in-cheek referred to as a \"Humbler\" to fact check everything they said. These Humblers would be provided from a non-partisan pool of individuals created from established parties, including the Cite-seers. Humblers also could not be from the same party as the candidate, themselves.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/April/07/","page":"The Humbler","title":"The Humbler","text":"At that time, many established politicians quit their job, leading to yet another exodus within congress. The remaining members of congress held special elections to fill all vacancies and since then, the US government has been much more in tune with what their population actually wants.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/April/07/","page":"The Humbler","title":"The Humbler","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/April/07/","page":"The Humbler","title":"The Humbler","text":"This story was inspired by: The Humble Servant law requires each politician to be accompanied by a Humbler at all times. The Humbler may not lie or reveal private info, but is expected to keep the politicians ego in check with constant ridicule and fact checks. The first campaign is about to begin.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/March/30/#The-Conscious-Actor","page":"The Conscious Actor","title":"The Conscious Actor","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"content/2022/March/30/","page":"The Conscious Actor","title":"The Conscious Actor","text":"Several years ago, I started my PhD in the area of computational thinking. It's a relatively new discipline that involves applying computational methods to traditionally non-computational tasks. The premise of my thesis was a simple question: is intelligence the consequence of any logical universal constraints? That is to say, if we create a simulation of another universe that follows similar constraints to our own, can conscious actors always appear, or is it a lucky, non-replicable coincidence?","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/March/30/","page":"The Conscious Actor","title":"The Conscious Actor","text":"To be honest, this was clearly too challenging of a task for a single PhD student, so my advisors and I applied for a series of grants that enabled our university to build a new cluster with the latest hardware along with a dedicated support staff. Soon, we were a team of about 20 researchers and technicians all working towards the same goal – replicating a conscious experience through only essential building blocks of life. We were given a year to develop the code while the cluster was being built and then a year of exclusive use to the compute resources before they would be redistributed to other projects, many of which were already applying for compute time.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/March/30/","page":"The Conscious Actor","title":"The Conscious Actor","text":"We quickly created several core concepts that would comprise the logical constraints for the simulation:","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/March/30/","page":"The Conscious Actor","title":"The Conscious Actor","text":"All objects will be a mixture of atoms, which are a single, discrete unit to build upon. Atoms will be made from a quark database that will create a mirror universe and compress the key findings of the simulation into a readable format.\nBecause we assume consciousness to be unstable, atoms must have a real, physical location within each simulation while also providing a probability distribution of different locations the atom could be at that same moment in time. In this way, our simulation would be a type of probabilistic rendering, showing the most likely outcome after N simulated days.\nThough we are only allowed to influence the initial distribution of atoms in the simulated universe, each universe will provide several children universes when the simulation ends. These children will start their simulation with a distribution of atoms that is most likely to create a conscious actor. This allows each universe to learn from it's parents with the hope of quickly finding the optimal set of initial parameters.\nWith our calculations, we would need 50 iterations for our simulations to converge to consciousness. Because we only had a year of computing time, this meant each simulation could take no longer than 7 days.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/March/30/","page":"The Conscious Actor","title":"The Conscious Actor","text":"With that, we got to work. Every day. Every night. One goal.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/March/30/","page":"The Conscious Actor","title":"The Conscious Actor","text":"At the start of this year, the simulations began. We've been monitoring the mirror universes and doing our best to analyze the data as quickly as possible. I am happy to report that the algorithm seems to be working as intended; however, the results have been less than compelling.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/March/30/","page":"The Conscious Actor","title":"The Conscious Actor","text":"For the first 4 months, every single simulation failed at the initialization step. It wasn't until April that the first star was created, and we had to wait until June for the first galaxy. In August, something unusual began to happen: Hydrogen and Oxygen combined into water for the first time, creating several habitable planets. In September, every single simulation began generating the same set of planets, with one in particular stealing the show: a small blue-green dot we called Earth. In November, we had our first single-celled organisms.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/March/30/","page":"The Conscious Actor","title":"The Conscious Actor","text":"The process was too slow. We were too far from our goal and even though we applied for more funding, none came. If this simulation did not create a conscious actor by the end of December, we would have nothing to show for years of work and an insane amount of funding. Sometimes that happens. It's the nature of research.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/March/30/","page":"The Conscious Actor","title":"The Conscious Actor","text":"Still, it was unsettling. We knew it would take several months for anything to happen, but we could do nothing but sit and wait while our simulations spiraled out of control again and again.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/March/30/","page":"The Conscious Actor","title":"The Conscious Actor","text":"Somehow, it was December 24th. Christmas Eve. Our final run. It was time for a miracle.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/March/30/","page":"The Conscious Actor","title":"The Conscious Actor","text":"In the beginning, the simulation started with a huge explosion creating the heavens and the Earth in a split second. The Earth began to spin, creating a day and night cycle. The planet warmed up, melting ice and creating a habitable atmosphere. We watched the waters and waited, hoping for bacteria to form. In almost no time, the Earth was inhabited by plants. Animals came soon thereafter. We had seen all this before.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/March/30/","page":"The Conscious Actor","title":"The Conscious Actor","text":"We needed something more.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/March/30/","page":"The Conscious Actor","title":"The Conscious Actor","text":"At the start of the seventh day, something peculiar happened. A new species of primate was developed without fur except on it's head. It did something we had never seen another creature do before: it tilled the land and grew crops. It created cities. It fought itself. It took over the world.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/March/30/","page":"The Conscious Actor","title":"The Conscious Actor","text":"But most importantly, it knew itself. It was conscious.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2022/March/30/","page":"The Conscious Actor","title":"The Conscious Actor","text":"We did it! Consciousness had been achieved!

With every new atom added into the system, the interactions with every other object must also be taken into account. The tedious bookkeeping here is intense.

N body simulations are well-known and used all the time in galaxy simulations, but unfortunately we just don't have the computing power to go beyond maybe a few dozen particles here. Again, the scaling is absolutely insane.\nExperimentally (via using literal atoms), one would need to trap a single atom and then slowly scale it up particle by particle until it is a macroscopic object.

No more, no less.\nWe usually request another member of the Genie Order for review because our standards are higher. We do not want the wish to be merely technically fulfilled, but also to make the human happy because of their wishes.\nIf anyone wishes to become a genie, we must – and I mean must – also ask how much magic they want. This skirts around the genie board's requirements because we are not explaining how magic works, only asking if they want a lot of it. Usually, they do.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2020/December/01/","page":"The Genie Order","title":"The Genie Order","text":"Point 4 is very important, so let me explain it a bit further.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2020/December/01/","page":"The Genie Order","title":"The Genie Order","text":"Because we must fulfill wishes in their entirety, we must provide extra magic to each of the new recruits, and this magic must go somewhere, so where does it go? Well, into the coffers of the Genie Order instead of the Coalition. This magic is used to not only make our wishes better, but also to pay for our annual bonuses, which is often higher than those in the Genie Coalition.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2020/December/01/","page":"The Genie Order","title":"The Genie Order","text":"Also, because we are only peer reviewing other members of the Genie Order, we can ensure that every human is happy with the outcome of their wishes and that no one outside the order knows where the excess magic goes.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2020/December/01/","page":"The Genie Order","title":"The Genie Order","text":"If I'm honest, the entire idea is a bit of a legal loophole, but I'm happy to use it to help people out.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2020/December/01/","page":"The Genie Order","title":"The Genie Order","text":"And now, as my new recruit, I cannot wait to see what you do!
