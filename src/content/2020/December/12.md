# This is Not the End

Beyond the window, a fierce storm rages --  
A hurricane, the strongest in ages.  
The wind ravages as the rain torments,  
And everyone hides from the day's events.  
The world, itself, is swept up in the storm.  
All are huddled in houses to stay warm.  
We hope for the best. We can not defend,  
But we still persist. This is not the end.  

A new day dawns, and people awaken.  
They rub at their eyes, feeling mistaken.  
Trees are upended and buildings askew,  
Now everything needs to be built anew.  
Many cracks are found in the foundation,  
From years of neglect, and some stagnation.  
There are immediate issues to tend,  
But we still persist. This is not the end.  

To forget the storm, we work day by day,  
Finding new people, showing them the way.  
The world is different without wind or rain,  
But some of the cracks have left a great stain.  
Slowly but surely, people come around,  
We work hard for peace and hope to abound  
It might seem hopeless. There is much to mend,  
But we still persist. This is not the end.
