Twitch is a platform used by gamers all over the world to watch each other play games in real time. For many professional streamers, Twitch offers a way for individuals to make a career out of doing what they love: playing video games. For the past few months, I have spent my time on Twitch.tv doing what I love: computational physics. I thought it would be interesting to write up my current thoughts on the matter and come back to it in a year's time to see if they have changed.

## Content of stream ##
We do physics on my channel. Real physics, not game physics. In terms of programming content: I don't care about applications, web development, security or any other big CS topics. I only care about one thing: learning physics algorithms. This means that even in terms of other programmers on Twitch, my channel is a bit of an outlier.

Am I an uber programmer? No. Am I a fantastic physicist? No. Am I a good streamer? Not really. Why do people watch? I don't really know, but I like to think that we learn things every day on my channel. 

I know one thing for certain: I enjoy coding physics algorithms, and I think that shows in my channel. 

Quite frankly, I have come to find out that the material we cover on my channel is difficult to understand. I do my best to describe things in simple terms, without jargon or unnecessary physics; however, the concepts of programming and the concepts of physics are both difficult in their own right. When combined, they evolve into an utterly incomprehensible nightmare. 

That said, at this point in my life,  I cannot say there is anything I enjoy doing more than just sitting back and learning some new physics algorithms. In this way, my channel provides a perfect creative outlet; however, there is one question that haunts every single stream:

## Why? ##
So, let's say you are streaming a video game or being creative in some way on twitch. Viewers will come in and out all the time and some of them will ask questions. How are you? What are you doing? Are you going to play / work on X in the future? These are all questions you might expect. One question you might not expect is: *Why are you doing this?* 

The answer is obvious, of course: you are doing what you are doing because you enjoy it!

In my case, though, people come to my channel all the time and ask what the program is for and when it will be used in the future. Every time I get this question, I am somewhat taken aback. There are a number of true responses I could give:

1. Programming is fun
2. There is no point to this code, we are just doing some physics
3. We are better refining our skills as programmers and physicists

The truth is programming is like any other form of creative expression. It takes time to master. If you do not spend the time to learn your own techniques and develop your own style, you are going to have trouble if you ever want to turn programming into a career. In this way, it makes sense that I practice programming by working on algorithms that will eventually become relevant to my research.

There are people out there who enjoy writing for writing's sake. Why can there not be programmers who enjoy programming for programming's sake?

Unfortunately, this is a difficult point to express.
